## chicago_lst

Portfolio project focused on **nighttime land surface temperature (LST)** and **data center locations**.

- **Web map**: NASA GIBS tiles + lightweight GeoJSON overlays
- **Analysis**: time series, anomaly/risk scoring, and (next) classification/inference

### Data center address source (Chicago list)

The Chicago data center address list was compiled from `https://www.datacentermap.com/usa/illinois/chicago/`
and pasted into `data/chicago_data_centers_183_source.txt` (then parsed + geocoded by `analysis/` scripts).
